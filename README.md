# Hash Tables Without Assumptions — Blog Series Code

This repository contains Rust code examples for the blog series  
**“Hash Tables Without Assumptions: Rethinking Open Addressing at Scale”**

## 📚 Series Overview

This series explores how modern non-greedy probing techniques — like **Elastic Hashing** and **Funnel Hashing** — challenge the classical $\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$ lower bound on probe complexity in open-addressed hash tables.

We walk through each concept with annotated, runnable Rust code.

**Planned posts:**

1. **The Invisible Wall Around Hash Tables**  
   Why greedy probing slows down — and how to see it in code.  
   ✅ *Code included in this repo*

2. **Beating the Bound — Without Reordering**  
   Elastic Hashing spreads keys across subarrays to reduce clustering.

3. **Inside Elastic Hashing**  
   Final probe logic, batch-friendly balancing, and sub-logarithmic probes.

4. **Funnel Hashing and Worst-Case Sanity**  
   A levelled fallback strategy with bounded worst-case probes.

5. **What Faster Hashing Means for Computing**  
   Why this changes the way we design data-heavy systems.

## 🦀 Running Post 1

To run the code for **Post 1**:

```bash
cargo run --bin post1-invisible-wall
cargo run
```

You’ll see a visualisation of how greedy insertion causes clustering — even when the table is mostly empty.

By default, it will initialise a table with 30 slots and insert 15 keys using a simple greedy strategy.

You can customise the run using CLI flags:

```bash
just post1 -- --slots 50 --keys 20 --hash-strategy default
```

**Usage:**

```text
post1-invisible-wall [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s, --slots <SLOTS>                  Number of slots in the table [default: 30]
  -k, --keys <KEYS>                    Number of keys to insert [default: 15]
      --hash-strategy <HASH_STRATEGY> Hash strategy to use [default: mod10]
                                      [possible values: default, mod10]
  -h, --help                           Print help
```

This lets you simulate different load factors and see how clustering appears — even when the table is mostly empty — based purely on the insertion strategy.

## 🧪 Development with Nix

This repo includes a `flake.nix` to provide a reproducible Rust environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

This gives you:

- `rustc`, `cargo`, `rust-analyzer`
- `cargo-watch` and `gnuplot` (for benchmarking)
