# Hash Tables Without Assumptions — Blog Series Code

This repository contains Rust code examples for the blog series  
**“Hash Tables Without Assumptions: Rethinking Open Addressing at Scale”**

→ [Read the series on fdmux.dev](https://fdmux.dev/series/hash-tables-without-assumptions)

## 📚 Series Overview

This series explores how modern non-greedy probing techniques — like **Elastic Hashing** and **Funnel Hashing** — challenge the classical $\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$ lower bound on probe complexity in open-addressed hash tables.

We walk through each concept with annotated, runnable Rust code.

**Planned posts:**

1. **The Invisible Wall Around Hash Tables**  
   Why greedy probing slows down — and how to see it in code.  
   ✅ *Code included in this repo*

2. **Beating the Bound — Without Reordering**  
   Elastic Hashing spreads keys across subarrays to reduce clustering.
   ✅ *Code included in this repo*

3. **Inside Elastic Hashing**  
   Final probe logic, batch-friendly balancing, and sub-logarithmic probes.

4. **Funnel Hashing and Worst-Case Sanity**  
   A levelled fallback strategy with bounded worst-case probes.

5. **What Faster Hashing Means for Computing**  
   Why this changes the way we design data-heavy systems.

## 🦀 Running Post 1

To run the code for **Post 1**:

```bash
cargo run --bin post1-invisible-wall
cargo run
```

You’ll see a visualisation of how greedy insertion causes clustering — even when the table is mostly empty.

By default, it will initialise a table with 30 slots and insert 15 keys using a simple greedy strategy.

You can customise the run using CLI flags:

```bash
just post1 -- --slots 50 --keys 20 --hash-strategy default
```

**Usage:**

```text
post1-invisible-wall [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s, --slots <SLOTS>                  Number of slots in the table [default: 30]
  -k, --keys <KEYS>                    Number of keys to insert [default: 15]
      --hash-strategy <HASH_STRATEGY> Hash strategy to use [default: mod10]
                                      [possible values: default, mod10]
  -h, --help                           Print help
```

This lets you simulate different load factors and see how clustering appears — even when the table is mostly empty — based purely on the insertion strategy.

## 📊 Running Post 2 — *Beating the Bound*

To explore **Post 2**, which compares different elastic hashing fallback strategies:

```bash
cargo run --bin post2-beating-the-bound
```

By default, this inserts 100 keys into a hash table with 4 subarrays and 32 slots each — using unbalanced and un-rotated hash probing. You'll see a visualisation of how keys cluster or spread depending on the configuration.

You can customise the behaviour using CLI flags:

```bash
just post2 -- --subarrays 4 --slots 32 --keys 100 --balanced --rotate-subarrays
```

### **Usage**

```text
Elastic Hashing Demo

Visualise elastic subarray-based hash table clustering

Options:
  -u, --subarrays <SUBARRAYS>           Number of subarrays [default: 4]
  -s, --slots <SLOTS>                   Number of slots per subarray [default: 32]
  -k, --keys <KEYS>                     Number of keys to insert [default: 100]
  -b, --balanced                        Use coordinated fallback [default: false]
      --rotate-subarrays               Rotate fallback starting point [default: false]
      --hash-strategy <HASH_STRATEGY>  Hash strategy to use [default: default]
                                       [possible values: default, mod10]
  -h, --help                            Print help
```

### 📈 Reproducing Benchmarks and Plots

To regenerate **all probe data** and create updated plots:

```bash
nix develop
just plot-probes
```

This runs:

- All probe generation tasks (`post1`, `post2-unbalanced-unrotated`, `post2-unbalanced`, `post2-balanced`)
- Python script to plot the probe curves

All CSVs are saved to `probe-data/`, and final images land in `probe-plots/`.

The output includes the figures used in [Post 2 on the blog](https://fdmux.dev/posts/beating-the-bound/), comparing fallback strategies and visualising how they scale under load.

## 🧪 Development with Nix

This repo includes a `flake.nix` to provide a reproducible Rust environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

This gives you:

- `rustc`, `cargo`, `rust-analyzer`
- `cargo-watch` and `gnuplot` (for benchmarking)
